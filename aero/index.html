    <h1>Project Overview</h1>
    <p>I was selected for the <a href="https://news.tongji.edu.cn/info/1002/82199.htm">QiDi program</a> at Tongji University and served as a key member on the project under the guidance of <a href="https://cse.tongji.edu.cn/6b/68/c15581a158568/page.htm">Prof. Peng Qi</a>. Our main goal is to design and build a robot system that can move faster and more flexibly and enter smaller spaces to detect damage. Our project was under the China National University Student Innovation & Entrepreneurship Development Program. I was primarily responsible for robot perception and partial system development of the robot.</p>
